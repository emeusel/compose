docker-compose (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Compose since version 1.3.0 now uses labels to identify containers. This
  means that containers created by older versions are incompatible with newer
  ones, and that the daemon has to be at least version 1.6.0.

  Compose will refuse to start containers where it detects that they were
  created with older versions.

  Please see the Upgrading section of /usr/share/doc/docker-compose/install.md
  for instructions on upgrading your containers.
